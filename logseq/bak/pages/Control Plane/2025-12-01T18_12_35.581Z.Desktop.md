- ![Diagram illustrating a Kubernetes control plane/master node architecture. The top section shows components within a green box labeled "CONTROL PLANE/MASTER NODE," including "Cloud Controller Manager," "SCHEDULER," "APISERVER," "CONTROLLER MANAGER," and "ETCD." Arrows indicate interactions between these components and with the "Cloud Provider API" and "Client" for API calls. The bottom section repeats the structure without the cloud interaction, focusing on internal component interactions. Key terms: Kubernetes, control plane, master node, API calls, ETCD, scheduler, controller manager.](http://localhost:5000/api/book/192/book-resources?file=..%2Fimages%2F644369_1_En_2_Chapter%2F644369_1_En_2_Fig2_HTML.jpg)
